# Test Document: Spring Framework Overview

Spring Framework is a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. It was created by Rod Johnson and first released in 2003.

## Core Features

### Dependency Injection
Spring's core container provides dependency injection (DI) functionality. DI is a design pattern that removes dependencies from your code, making it easier to test and maintain.

### Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)
Spring AOP enables modularization of cross-cutting concerns. Examples include logging, security, and transaction management.

### Spring MVC
Spring MVC is a web framework that follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. It provides a clean separation between domain model code and web forms.

### Data Access
Spring provides excellent support for data access frameworks including JDBC, JPA, and Hibernate. It simplifies database operations and exception handling.

### Transaction Management
Spring Framework provides a consistent abstraction for transaction management that scales down to local transactions and scales up to global transactions (JTA).

## Spring Boot

Spring Boot was introduced in 2014 to simplify Spring application development. It provides:
- Auto-configuration
- Standalone applications
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty)
- Production-ready features
- No code generation or XML configuration required

## Spring Ecosystem

The Spring ecosystem includes:
- Spring Data: Simplifies data access
- Spring Security: Authentication and authorization
- Spring Cloud: Microservices infrastructure
- Spring Batch: Batch processing framework
- Spring Integration: Enterprise integration patterns
