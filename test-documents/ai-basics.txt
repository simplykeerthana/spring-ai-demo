# Test Document: Artificial Intelligence Basics

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Designed to perform a specific task, such as:
- Voice recognition
- Image classification
- Playing chess
- Driving a car

### General AI (Strong AI)
Hypothetical AI that possesses the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a human level.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Supervised Learning
The algorithm learns from labeled training data to predict outcomes for new data.

### Unsupervised Learning
The algorithm finds patterns in data without pre-existing labels.

### Reinforcement Learning
The algorithm learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to analyze data. Applications include:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Speech Recognition
- Recommendation Systems

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data. Examples include:
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI)

These models can:
- Generate human-like text
- Answer questions
- Translate languages
- Summarize documents
- Write code

## AI Ethics

Important considerations:
- Bias in AI systems
- Privacy concerns
- Job displacement
- Accountability and transparency
- Environmental impact

## Future of AI

AI continues to evolve rapidly, with potential impacts on:
- Healthcare diagnostics
- Climate change solutions
- Education personalization
- Scientific research acceleration
- Creative arts
